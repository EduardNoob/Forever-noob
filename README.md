# Forever-noob
#Always a noob, never learning not to mention mastering something. Help appreciated, thanks. 
#Started the "coder" life with hacking ZX Spectrum games, lots of PEEKs and POKEs now I don't remember a a bit of it. 
Wish I could remember at least the POKE for beeping the keyboard.
sounded so techy at that time. 
At college started some FORTRAN courses. Forgotten... 
Then, Arduino! Finally a reason to code, yess! Unfortunately, I'm so unmotivated that all my projects are lying in Styrofoam cases waiting to be accomplished. 
Now, the big deal is Python, baby. I was fascinated from the beginning by Python ever since I was playing with Poser (or was it DAZ 3D?) All the articulations of the mannequin ending with  *.py
What the heck is this py program that manages the beautiful graphics, caring not to mess around.
Well,
